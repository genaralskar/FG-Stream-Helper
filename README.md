# FG Stream Helper
FG Stream Helper is a simple tool that allows you to quickly and easily update player names, scores, icons, and bracket text without having to open up and edit all the settings in your streaming software! Spend less time with the little details and more time playing!

FG Stream Helper exports this information to individual text files that your streaming software can use for text elements. These files can be found in the "out" folder.

## Quickly update the set info!
Just fill out the players names, the bracket, and set the scores. Sit submit and it will update it for you! With Auto Update Scores enabled, you don't even need to hit submit, just change the score and it will update!

## smash.gg Import
Setting up is even easier now! Just copy paste the link to a smash.gg set and it will auto populate the information! (player images still need to be set manually)
Your options are exported as .txt and image files that you can set your streaming software to read so you can change them with ease!

### An authentication token from smash.gg is required to use the import feature!
There is an auth.txt file with FG Stream Helper folder. Inside it you will find a link showing how to get an auth token from smash.gg. Just replace the first line in the file with that auth code, restart the program, and you're good to go!

## Images
(This feature does not work 100% for some reason) Want to choose some pictures to export too? Just drop them into the "images" folder and they show up in FG Stream Helper! Choose an image for each player and they will export into the out folder like everything else.
